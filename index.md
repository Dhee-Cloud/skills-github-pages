title: Learning Version Control using Git and GitHub
---
I have successfully understood the concept behind version control
It is basically controlling and monitoring changes to your website or application
So with GitHub, you can create your apps repo which will come with a default main branch, then make changes in a new branch push these changes and merge them to the main branch to complete the change in your application or Website
I understand commits,push, pull request, merge and other things used in GitHub
